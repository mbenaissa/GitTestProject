GitTestProject
==============

This project is just a test one used to make tests and workshops on Git

The convention of adding commit is to prefix them by the folowing keys :
- doc,
- test,
- bugfix,
- feature
...

Testing before or after commit ?

Should we use TDD ?

No PR revert for now, always fix issue in targeted branch.

Revert PR block future PR of a branch ?

add modification from Dev and pull it to the master
